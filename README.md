## About me

Hi, I’m Zubayda, a developer from London with a background in chemistry education. I am a graduate of Makers Academy Software development (DevOps stream) bootcamp (July-Oct 2023).

## What I'm Working On

🔭 Currently, I'm honing my skills in Kubernetes, Terraform, Python, and Ansible.

🔐 At Makers, my latest projects focused on mitigating security vulnerabilities using SAST & DAST tools, and ensuring system reliability and availability through NGINX reverse proxy, CloudFront caching, and monitoring with AWS Athena and CloudWatch.  

📖 I'm currently delving into 'The Unicorn Project' by Gene Kim, exploring the intricacies of developers' roles in digital disruption.  

💻 Open to opportunities in DevOps, Cloud Computing, Site reliability engineering, Platform engineering and Software engineering.
